## 🎓 My Academic Journey

- 📘 Started with **B.Com in 2009**, completed all semesters
- Couldn’t obtain the degree due to a ₹1500 fee—significant for me at the time
- Persisted for years; in 2023, I traveled 200+ km, stayed on-site, and uncovered that **Semester 4 records were never updated**, which blocked my degree issuance
- Decided to move forward—enrolled in **BCA (Amity Online)** instead
  - Performing strongly in academics and technology
  - Committed to completing **BCA → Master’s → M.Tech**
  - Goal: Become a formally recognized **Enterprise Architect** with both practical and academic credibility

## 🎯 Vision & Values

- I believe in building by example: clean systems, scalable design, strong mentorship
- My career is built on **resilience**, **consistency**, and a long-term **systems thinking** mindset
- Academic excellence will complement my practical depth — no shortcuts, only growth
